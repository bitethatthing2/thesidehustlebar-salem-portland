## Subject: Wolf Pack Platform Schema Requirements - Salem & Portland Creative Community Hub

Dear Backend Development Team,

We have developed a comprehensive social platform called **Wolf Pack** that serves as a creative and business collaboration hub for Salem and Portland communities. This is a TikTok-style video sharing platform with expanded categories designed to unite local businesses, artists, events, and community activities.

## Platform Overview

Wolf Pack is a vertical video feed platform similar to TikTok, but specifically designed for the Pacific Northwest creative community. Our mission is to connect local businesses, artists, musicians, event organizers, and community members in Salem and Portland, creating a unified ecosystem where "we are strong together."

## Current Frontend Implementation

### Video Feed Categories (Horizontal Slider Menu)
We have implemented 11 distinct content categories:

1. **LIVE** - Live streaming events and real-time content
2. **For You** - Personalized algorithm-driven content
3. **Following** - Content from followed users/businesses
4. **Festivals** - Local festivals and fairs (Waterfront Blues Festival, etc.)
5. **Food & Wine** - Culinary events, wine tastings, restaurant content
6. **Arts & Culture** - Local art exhibitions, cultural events, creative showcases
7. **Sports** - Sporting events, local teams, athletic activities
8. **Community** - Community meetings, local government, neighborhood events
9. **Family** - Family-friendly activities and events
10. **Music** - Live music, concerts, local bands, music festivals
11. **Markets** - Saturday Market, farmers markets, local vendors

### Key Features Currently Implemented
- TikTok-style vertical video scrolling
- Location-based content (Salem/Portland)
- User profiles with verification badges
- Comments system
- Like/reaction system
- Share functionality
- Bookmark system
- Upload capabilities (photo/video)
- Real-time notifications
- Music attribution
- Hashtag system
- Location badges

## Questions for Backend Team

1. Can you implement real-time streaming capabilities?
2. What's the recommended approach for video compression and delivery?
3. How should we handle cross-location content discovery?
4. What analytics tracking do you recommend for business accounts?
